Weighted Averages: Give more weight to recent songs or songs that the listener has played more frequently in the past year to better reflect their current preferences.

Genre-specific Analysis: Instead of averaging across all genres, analyze the audio aura separately for different genres present in the top 100 songs. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the listener's preferences.

Incorporate Listening Patterns: Consider the time of day, moods, and activities during which the listener plays specific songs. This could provide a more context-aware analysis of their audio aura.

Dynamic Analysis: Instead of a static average, analyze the dynamics of the listener's musical preferences over time to capture shifts in mood or taste.
