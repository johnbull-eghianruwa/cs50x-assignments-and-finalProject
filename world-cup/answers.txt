Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
he prediction that proved incorrect as the number of simulations increased is the time for
 10000 simulations, which unexpectedly decreased to 0m0.0221s. This contradicts the trend of
 increasing time with a higher number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 simulations, where
the time is 0m0.39s. Therefore, you might consider the predictions "good enough"
 after 1000 simulations.
